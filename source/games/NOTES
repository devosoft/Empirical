All games should have common types and functions for easy use in templates:

using move_t = MOVE_TYPE;
     What type should be used for all moves?

void Reset()
     Restart the game (using the same settings)

std::unordered_map<int, double> AsInput(size_t player_id) const
     Store the current state of the game as a map for easy loading.

bool DoMove(size_t player, move_t move)
     Specify a move to be made by a player.
     Return value indicates if player needs to make another decisions (or go again)

bool IsDone()
     Test: is the game finished?

bool IsMoveValid(size_t player, move_t move)
     Test: is a provided move legal? 

emp::vector<move_t> GetMoveOptions()
     Return the available moves to choose from (needed to run a random player!)

double GetScore(size_t player)
     How is the specified player doing?
     In a binary win/lose game, these scores will be 0/1 at the end of the game.

void Print(std::ostream & os=std::cout)
     Print out the current state of the game.
