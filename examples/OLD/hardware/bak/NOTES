When building a new hardware type that works with emp::InstSet, you must publicly define define:

 id_t for the enumerated base type of each instruction.
 arg_t for the types of each instruction argument (can be anything if not using args.)

Further, the enumerated id_t must have an "Unknown" option for proper error management.



When using InstLib, you must initialize all instructions and all arguments so that they can be loaded properly.
