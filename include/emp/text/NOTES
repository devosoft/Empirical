Emphatic is an internal coding for Empirical that will try to support as many text encodings as reasonable, simplifying the conversion between them while being easy to write to in code (via the emp::Text object.)

Supported text formats:
 TXT (plain text - working)
 HTML (simple tags working)
 LATEX
 MARKDOWN
 RTF
 XML
 MarkBack (custom markup language; simple tags working)

Internal encoding (Emphatic)
 The Emphatic encoding maintains a string of characters, each associated with any number of styles.  The standard styles are:
  bold
  code
  comment (text that should not be shown in final output)
  italic
  strike (for strikethrough)
  subscript
  superscript
  underline

 Some styles are only associated with individual special characters (usually matched with a space).  This are:
  no_break - non-breaking space
  bullet
  ordered
  indent
  blockquote - Marks this line as being part of a blockquote.

 Additional styles are followed by a colon and details must be provided.
  header - followed by header level (e.g.: header:1)
  link - text should redirect to provided URL (e.g.: link:https://google.com)
  image - followed by location of image.
  


---------------------------------------


MarkBack notes:
  New format is .mback, which is inspired by markdown, but uses just two types of special characters for formatting:
     Backquotes (`) indicate a change in text STYLE
     Backslashes (\) indicate a special CHARACTER
   
  The following tags toggle a formatting STYLE.
  
   `*Bold!`*
   ``Code``
   `/Italic`/
   `_Underlined!`_
   `^Superscript`^
   `.Subscript`.
   `~Strikethrough`~
   `<{URL}Linked-text goes here`>
   `#{hashtag}Tagged text`#

  Color changes are placed in brackets.

   `[blue]This text would be blue
   `[#FF00FF]This text would be magenta
   `[]This text would be back to default color.

  You can end ALL special formatting with `!

  Code -- see below.
   `{var name=value or other_code}
   `?{TEST}Optional formatting  -- e.g., ?{has_error}[red] or ?{important}*
  
  The following tags change the format for the rest of the line they are on.  These should generally be the first non-whitespace on a line, but if not a newline will be assumed before them.
  
   `" Blockquote
   `% Comment that will be removed.
   `| Continues the previous line for other tags in this group.
      
   Anything with three backticks (```) before and after will be treated as code blocks.
   Add a `= at the beginning of a line if you don't want any special formatting on that line.
    
   A single or double backtick indicates that everything in between is going to be inline
   code.  A single backtick must be followed by an alphanumeric character or whitespace,
   but a double backtick can be followed by anything.
  
   `This would be rendered as CODE`
   ``{This would also be code, _with_ the braces appearing}``


  Unused symbols for style: @$&()-=+;:',
  ALSO unused, but less useful: ]}

  The following tags handle special CHARACTERS:

   \\ is a regular backslash ('\')
   \` is a regular backtick ('`')
   \#{Heading}
   \##{Heading level 2}
   \### etc. deeper headings.
   \| is the beginning of a table line (rest of line is markdown format...?)
   \_ is a non-breaking space.
   \. is nothing. Use to separate other text (e.g., for unicode immediately followed by a number)
   \- is a horizontal rule
   \^{note} creates an footnote.  This is a superscript value with the contents included at the end of the page (or end of document if no pagebreaks)
   \* is a bullet which will start a list entry
   \+ is a consecutive number bullet, incrementing if in a list
   \={123} (or any other numbers or letters) is a specified value for a bullet (a subsequent \+, \a, or \R will continue from it)
   \a is an alphabetic bullet, incrementing if in a list
   \b is a page break
   \d{name} creates a division with a specified name
   \n is a line break (newline)
   \p is a paragraph break
   \t is a tab
   \R is a roman numeral bullet, incrementing if in a list
   \(123) (or any other number) converts to the associated unicode character.
   \<URL> or \<#hashtag> will place a link this point WITH itself as the text
   \[URL] will RESOLVE a URL to an image (or somethign else?) and place it here
   \:name: por \:{name} will place the emoji associated with 'name'
   \&name; or \&{name} insert a character by a given name
   \${var_value_printed_here} - see below
   \?{TEST}{Optional text} - insert only if TEST is true.

  Unused symbols for insertions: ~!@%;'",/ plus lots of letters
  ALSO technically unused, but less useful: ]>})


  Now for the crazy.  We can EMBED CODE as needed.
  
   `{var name=value or other_code}
   \${var_value_printed_here}
   `?{TEST}Optional formatting  -- e.g., ?{has_error}[red] or ?{important}*
   \?{TEST}{Optional text} - insert only if TEST is true.






Some saved notes:
    // Tag layout differs substantially from one language to the next.  For example, to make
    // text have the style "bold", it may look like:
    //   HTML:      One word is <b>bold</b>.
    //   MarkDown:  One word is *bold*.
    //   LaTeX:     One word is \textbf{bold}.
    //   MarkBack:  One word is `*bold`*
    //
    // Some styles need to have arguments associated with them.  For example, a heading needs
    // to have a level.  A level 3 heading, for example, would be stored as style "heading:3".
    //   HTML:      <h3>A level 3 heading</h3>
    //   MarkDown:  ### A level 3 heading
    //   LaTeX:     \subsubsection{A level 3 heading}
    //   MarkBack:  `### A level 3 heading
    //
    // The patterns associated with these can either be broken up into multiple tags (for example,
    // in LaTeX it's easier to match a specific "\subsubsection{" open tag with "header:3" style),
    // while HTML can use the pattern "H$d" mapping to "header:$0".  In Markdown we would use
    // "$r{#}" mapping to "header:$0"
    //
    // Finally, more complex tags are possible.  For example, if a tag is supposed to map a
    // series of words to a linked URL:
    //   HTML:      This is <a href="http://www.exmaple.com/">linked</a> text.
    //   MarkDown:  This is [linked](http://www.exmaple.com/) text.
    //   LaTeX:     This is \href{http://www.exmaple.com/}{linked} text.
    //   MarkBack:  This is `[linked](http://www.exmaple.com/) text.
    //
    // For these patterns, HTML open would look like: <a href="%u">
    // And it would be set to the style: "link:$0".

Original comments on tag pattern:
      // What pattern will identify this tag?  Any characters EXCEPT $ will be taken literally.
      // $$ will be a single $.  A $ followed by a letter will have a specific meaning.
      //   $d = A single digit (0 to 9)
      //   $f = Any filename (includes a-z, A-Z, 0-9, '_', '/', '.', and '-')
      //   $i = Any identifier sequence (includes a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and '_')
      //   $n = Any whole number sequence (a series of digits)
      //   $r{pattern} = A repeated pattern
      //   @CAO FUTURE ADDITION: $t = Any normal text
      //   $u = Any URL

For style replacements:
      // A more complex style uses a replacement pattern to generate its description.  It can use $0
      // through $9 for the $letter material in the pattern. (e.g., a font should track the
      // name of the font.)

And for converting a pattern to a normal regex:
```cpp
      std::string AsRegEx() {
        std::string out;
        for (size_t i = 0; i < pattern.size(); ++i) {
          if (pattern[i] == '$') {
            ++i;
            emp_assert(i < pattern.size());
            switch (pattern[i]) {
              case '$': out += "$"; break;
              case 'd': out += "[0-9]"; break;
              case 'f': out += "[a-zA-Z0-9_/.-]+"; break;
              case 'i': out += "[a-zA-Z0-9_]+"; break;
              case 'n': out += "[0-9]+"; break;
              case 'r':
                {
                  size_t start = i;
                  i = emp::find_paren_match(pattern, i, '{', '}', false);
                  out += "\"" + pattern.substr(start+1, i-start-1) + "\"+";
                }
                break;
              case 't': out += "[]"; break;
              case 'u': out += "[a-zA-Z0-9_/.+:-]"; break;
            }
          }
          else if (pattern[0] == '[') out += "[\\[]";
          else if (pattern[0] == ']') out += "[\\]]";
          else if (pattern[0] == '*') out += "[*]";
          else if (pattern[0] == '.') out += "[.]";
          else if (pattern[0] == '+') out += "[+]";
          else if (pattern[0] == '?') out += "[?]";
          else if (pattern[0] == '|') out += "[|]";
          else if (pattern[0] == '(') out += "[()]";
          else if (pattern[0] == ')') out += "[)]";
          else out += pattern[i];
        }
        return out;
      }
```
