 *  @brief Tools to calculate Information Theory metrics.
 *  @note Status: ALPHA
 *
 *  Info-theory formulas:
 *    H(X)   = -SUM(X: p[x] log2 p[x])
 *    H(X|Y) = H(XY) - H(Y)
 *    I(X:Y) = H(X) - H(X|Y)
 *    H2(p)  = -p log2(p) - (1-p)log2(1-p)  = H({p, 1-p})
 *
 *  Developer notes:
 *  - Input may come as WEIGHTS or as ELEMENTS (or both!).
 *    ELEMENTS need to be converted to WEIGHTS for calculations.
 *  - Want basic info theory functions, as well as tools (for channels, error-correction,
 *    compression, etc.)
