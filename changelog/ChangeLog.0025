	* Makefile, tests/Makefile: Implemented diff-cover maketargets
	* third-party/{install_sphinx.sh,install_pip_deps.sh,requirements.txt}:
	Switched to the pip dependency list install system instead of some
	convoluted method.
	* doc/dev/contribution-guidelines-and-review.rst: added diff-cover
	maketarget to the review checklist.
	* .gitignore: added diff-cover stuff to gitignore
