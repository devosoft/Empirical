Built With Empirical Gallery
============================

This listing showcases web tools built using Empirical.
Put in a PR or raise an issue to have *your* project featured!

- `Choose Your Words!`_ `[source]`__

  - A pedagogical example of dynamic programming.

- `circle replicators with simple physics example`_ `[source]`__

  - interactive web demo of Empirical's circle physics with 'circle organisms' eating nutritious 'circle food' in order to self-replicate
  - WARNING: Built using a 2017 version of Empirical; source may be out of date with current version of Empirical.

- `dishtiny web viewer`_ `[source]`__

  - interactive web demo of an artificial life platform built to study major transitions in evolution

- `ecology of evolutionary computation`_ `[source]`__

  - interactive exploration of interaction networks in evolutionary computation under different selection schemes

- `Evoke`_ `[source]`__

  - evolving cells in a 2D physics environment that can link together like Snowflake Yeast

- `kmeans clustering example`_ `[source]`__
  
  - interactive kmeans clustering demonstration

- `spatial lineage visualization`_ `[source]`__

  - a phylogeny color-coded by each individual's position in the world, demonstrating the spatial dynamics of an evolving population

- `Model of cancer evolution on an oxygen gradient`_ `[source]`__
  
  - A companion model to a series of wet lab experiments on cancer evolution in spatially heterogenous environments

- `Model of evolution with varying genomic instability`_ `[source]`__
  
  - This model was built in a day during the 2019 [IMO workshop](http://psoc.moffitt.org/education/psoc-annual-workshop/) to identify the parameter ranges under which it might be possible to treat cancer by altering genomic stability.

- `A.A.G.O.S.`_ `[source]`__

  - An interactive artificial life model that demonstrates (1) how changing environments can promote the evolution of modular genetic architectures and (2) how high mutation rates can promote the evolution of more compact architectures (more goverlapping genes).
  
- `Symbulation`_ `[source]`__

  - An interactive artificial life model focused on the evolution of symbiosis between parasitism to mutualism. Also features a game to recreate major results from published work.
