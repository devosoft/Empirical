Empirical is a library of tools for scientific software development with an
emphasis on being able to build web interfaces using Emscripten, vastly
improving the reproducibility of the project. 

Emscripten is a C++ project though it uses Python for development
infrastructure. 

The developer documentation is for contributing to the Emscripten project and
the user documentation is for those wanting to incorporate Emscripten within
their own projects.
