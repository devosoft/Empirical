# Web Tools

The web tools in Empirical are structured to allow the developer to
fully control components of a web page from C++. Note that you must have
the emscripten compiler installed for web utilities to function
properly.

Empirical web Widgets include Text, Buttons, Images, Tables, or many
other HTML components. All widgets are derived from `emp::Widget` and
structured such that multiple widgets can properly refer to and modify
the same component.

## A Simple Example

In order to get a simple example working, you need:

-   an HTML file (the default version is effective in most cases),
-   the C++ code file to actually control the web page, and
-   the necessary flags to compile (again, the default version should
    work).

The required files are all in `examples/web/` called `Example.html`,
`Example.cc` and `Makefile`.

Here is `Example.html`:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Example</title>
</head>
<body>
<div id="emp_base"></div>
<script src="jquery-1.11.2.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="Example.js"></script>

</body>
</html>
```

The only portions of this file that should be customized for your
project are the title (in the `<title>` tags) and the JavaScript file
(change `Example.js` to the name of the `.js` file that you want to
generate). The div, named `"emp_base"`, is where we will hook Empirical
to this web page. You MAY add more divs to control or customize any
aspects of this file's CSS, but none of this is required for developing
an interface, and most of it can be controlled via C++.

Here is the `Example.cc` file:

```cpp
#include "emp/web/web.hpp"

namespace UI = emp::web;

UI::Document doc("emp_base");

int main() {
  doc << "<h1>Hello World!</h1>";
}
```

This setup will create a web page the says "Hello World!" in large
letters. Manipulations to doc will allow us to control many portions of
the web page. To break down what's going on, including `web/web.h`
pulls in Empirical's web framework. Setting the namespace to `UI`
provides a shorter prefix for accessing widgets. Creating the `doc`
`Document` object attaches to the div by the same `"emp_base"` name in
the HTML file. Note the `doc` is global because we want the web page to
keep functioning after `main()` finishes. In emscripten, `main()` is
like any other function and does not force the termination of the
execution.

Now that we have the two files we need, the only other thing we need to
do is compile. The provided Makefile can be run by typing
`make Example.js`. This will trigger:

```shell
emcc -std=c++20 -Wall -Wno-unused-function -I../../include/emp/ -Os -s "EXTRA_EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS=['ccall', 'cwrap']" -s TOTAL_MEMORY=67108864 --js-library ../../include/emp/web/library_emp.js -s EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS="['_main', '_empCppCallback']" -s NO_EXIT_RUNTIME=1 Example.cc -o Example.js
```

-   emscripten uses the `emcc` compiler (or `em++`, since we are using
    C++).

-   `-std=c++20` : Empirical requires c++20.

-   `-Wall -Wno-unused-function` : turn on all warnings by default
    except for unused functions, since not all library functions are
    going to be used.

-   `-I../../include/` : The compiled file is two directories up in the
    Empirical library, so this flag properly includes the source files.

-   `-Os` : Optimize for size, though `-O3` may perform better in some
    situations.

-   `-s TOTAL_MEMORY=67108864` : Make sure we have enough memory; in
    this case reserve 64 MB.

-   `--js-library ../../include/emp/web/library_emp.js` : Load Empirical JS
    functions that we might need.

-   `-s EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS="['_main', '_empCppCallback']"` : Make sure
    we can run the C++ functions `main()` and `_empCppCallback()` from
    Javascript, to facilitate two-way communication.

-   `-s "EXTRA_EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS=['ccall', 'cwrap']"` :
    expose necessary Emscripten utilities for internal Empirical use

-   `-s NO_EXIT_RUNTIME=1` : In most cases, we don't want our program
    to stop when `main()` finishes.

...finally we list the source file we are compiling (`Example.cc`) and
the output file that we want to produce (`Example.js`). The majority of
these flags shouldn't change from one compilation to the next, other
than changing optimization to debugging options, which we'll cover in
the debugging guide.

If you want to speed things up further, you may also want to add the
compiler option

> `-DNDEBUG` : turn off debugging for a faster executable

To test the results, open `Example.html` in your web browser!

## Controlling a Web Page: The Basics

To understand how most of the HTML widgets work we need only change the
main code file; the current HTML file and compiler options can be left
the same.

As indicated by our starting point, text can be streamed into an HTML
document in a similar way to an output stream in the standard library.
For example, we can update our main function to mix text and variables:

```cpp
int main() {
  int x = 5;
  doc << "<h1>Hello World!</h1>";
  doc << "x = " << x << ".<br>";
}
```

In additional to regular variables, `emp::Document` (and other Empirical
web containers) can also take a range of Empirical Widgets.

```cpp
void Ping() { doc << "Ping! "; }
int main() {
  int x = 5;
  doc << "<h1>Hello World!</h1>";
  doc << "x = " << x << ".<br>";

  // Insert an image (in place)
  doc << UI::Image("url.goes.here") << "<br>";

  // Create a button and then insert it.
  UI::Button my_button( Ping, "Click me!" );
  doc << my_button;
}
```

Notice now that you not only have a pretty picture, but you also have a
button that will add new text on to the screen each time it's clicked.

But what if we want to update existing content? We can do this in two
ways: either by marking a variable (or function) as "Live" or by
simply changing a widget that is already on the screen.

## "Live" Variables and Function

Anything sent to a web page that is inside a `UI::Live()` function will
always have its most current value used whenever that portion of the
page is redrawn. For example, let's make our button modify the value of
`x` and redraw it.

```cpp
int x = 5;
int main() {
  doc << "<h1>Hello World!</h1>";
  doc << "Original x = " << x << ".<br>";
  doc << "Current x = " << UI::Live(x) << ".<br>";

  // Create a button to modify x.
  UI::Button my_button( [](){ x+=5; doc.Redraw(); }, "Click me!" );
  doc << my_button;
}
```

Notice that we also moved `x` to be a global variable. This is because
if it were local to `main()` it would be freed as soon as main ended.
We're also using a lambda this time instead of a previously defined
function. Either option is fine.

Try clicking on the button -- you'll see that `x` will be updated, and
then the document is signaled that it needs to redraw, so the change is
reflected on the screen. Note that we didn't actually need to redraw
the entire document to update `x`, just the `Text` widget it is in;
we'll talk more about how to do that below.

Of course, we can put a function in the `UI::Live()` and that function
will be called each time the containing Widget is redrawn.

```cpp
int x = 5;
int main() {
  doc << "<h1>Hello World!</h1>";
  doc << "Original x = " << x << ".<br>";
  doc << "Current x = " << UI::Live(x) << ".<br>";
  doc << "x/5 = " << UI::Live( [](){ return x/5; } ) << ".<br>";

  // Create a button to modify x.
  UI::Button my_button( [](){ x+=5; doc.Redraw(); }, "Click me!" );
  doc << my_button;
}
```

Of course, we need to be able to modify Widgets in addition to
variables; fortunately this is easy as well.

## Finding and Modifying Existing Widgets

There are two ways to keep track of Widgets in Empirical. One is to
simply hold on to a variable associated with the Widget, such as
`my_button` in our previous examples. At any point we can still modify
something about `my_button`. For example, if we added a line at the end
of main:

```cpp
my_button.Label("PLEASE Click Me!");
```

We will see that the button label updates to the new string.

The other option we have to keep track of a widget is to specify its
HTML identifier so that we can look it up again later. For example, if
when we first declared `my_button` we had given it an extra string
argument, that string would be used as its identifier.

```cpp
UI::Button my_button( [](){ x+=5; doc.Redraw(); }, "Click me!", "my_button" );
```

At any point after we insert the button into a container (such as
`doc`), we are able to request it back from the container again. So, for
example instead of

```cpp
my_button.SetLabel("PLEASE Click Me!");
```

we could have said

```cpp
doc.Button("my_button").SetLabel("PLEASE Click Me!");
```

and `doc` will properly look up the correct button for us (or trip an
assert if the required button cannot be found.) In practice, allowing
containers to track Widgets is much easier than juggling links to all of
them yourself.

## Controlling CSS

Web page aesthetics are controlled by adjusting the CSS of the widgets,
and Empirical is no different. You have two options for controlling CSS
-- you can do it the traditional way by modifying the HTML file (often
with the help of other packages) or else you can control specific CSS
settings with the `.CSS` member function associated with all Widgets.

For example, if we wanted our button to be green with red text, we could
add to the end of `main` the statement

```cpp
my_button.SetCSS("background-color", "green").SetCSS("color", "red");
```

Note the chaining of modifiers.

Most common settings are directly defined as member functions, so the
above could also be expressed as

```cpp
my_button.SetBackground("green").SetColor("red");
```

which can be cleaner. See the class documentation for a full list of
available functions to modify each Widget type.

## Empirical Tables

Tables are one of the features of Empirical that differs most in style
from the underlying HTML it modifies, preferring a more exact form where
the user sets the number of rows and columns to be used.

For example, to build a table with 7 rows and 3 columns, we can declare

```cpp
UI::Table my_table(7, 3, "my_table");
```

To access a cell from a table, we can simply use the `.GetCell(x,y)`
member function. So if we want to fill the table with data, we might do
something like

```cpp
for (size_t r = 0; r < 7; r++) {
  for (size_t c = 0; c < 3; c++) {
    my_table.GetCell(r,c) << (r+3*c);
  }
}
```

To make the table pretty, we probably want to add some CSS.

```cpp
my_table.SetCSS("border-collapse", "collapse");
my_table.SetCSS("border", "3px solid");
my_table.CellsCSS("border", "1px solid");
my_table.CellsCSS("padding", "3px");
```

Note that we are able to target the CSS of all `TableCells` at once.

We can target individual cells using `GetCell()`, as well as using
`GetRow()`, `GetCol()`, `GetRowGroup()`, and `GetColGroup()`. Each of
these returns a `TableWidget` with the appropriate component in focus,
so additional modifications are handled correctly.

Finally, of course, make sure to insert the table into the document.

```cpp
doc << my_table;
```

## Canvas

Canvas widgets in Empirical are a slightly streamlined version of
canvases in HTML. To build one, you simply need to create an
`emp::Canvas` object (with the appropriate size) and place it into the
document. For example

```cpp
UI::Canvas my_canvas(300, 400, "my_canvas");
```

would create a 300x400 canvas. We can then use member functions to draw
lines, circles, and rectangles on the `Canvas`. For example:

```cpp
my_canvas.Circle(100, 100, 40, "red", "black");
```

would draw a circle at (100,100) with a radius of 40, a face color of
red, and an outline of black.

Note also that a number of `Draw()` function exist for `Canvas` that
will allow more complex structures to be drawn easily, such as grids
where the colors of each position are specified. Several other Empirical
tools hook into `Canvas`. For example if you are building a world with
`emp::Surface`, that surface can be handed to canvas to have all of the
shapes on it (currently just circles) drawn for you.
