Empirical is a library of tools for scientific software development with
an emphasis on being able to build web interfaces using Mozilla\'s
Emscripten compiler. The project goal is to improve the accessibility
and reproducibility of the computational research.

Empirical is a C++ project though it uses Python for development
infrastructure.

The developer documentation is for contributing to the Empirical project
and the user documentation is for those wanting to incorporate the
Empirical library into their own projects.
