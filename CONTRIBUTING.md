# Contributing to Empirical

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Proposing new features
- Submitting new code
- Writing documentation

## Reporting bugs

To report bugs, please [open an issue on Github](https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical/issues) 
clearly stating the observed (buggy) behavior (screenshots are encouraged), the desired behavior, 
which operating system and compiler you're using (including version), and any additional information that might 
help us fix the bug. If possible, please provide a minimum example that reproduces the bug.

## Requesting features

We welcome suggestions for how to make Empirical better! To give us your ideas, [open an issue on Github](https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical/issues). 

## Submitting new code and documentation

Empirical is developed by a group of computational scientists, none of whom can be full-time software developers.
We try to fix bugs and implement new features as quickly as we can, but we can't make any promises.
For these reasons, we highly encourage contributors to submit code fixing bugs or implementing new features!
By working together, we can have a more versatile and robust library than any of us could write individually.

Before writing new code, we reccomend opening an issue or commenting on an existing one to make sure that we're all on the
same page and agree that your contribution will be consistent with Empirical's goals.

In-depth guides to [getting started with Empirical development](https://empirical.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/getting-started.html), 
[coding guidelines for Empirical development](https://empirical.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/contribution-guidelines-and-review.html),
[writing documentation](https://empirical.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/adding-documentation.html), and
[writing tests](https://empirical.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/guide-to-testing.html) are available in the documentation.

Once you start working on a feature, we recommend making a pull request and giving it the "Merge: not ready" label. This way it's easy for everyone
to keep tabs on ongoing Empirical development and the status of new features. Once you're done developing, remove the "Merge: not ready" label and
add the "Merge: ready" label so that we know your pull request is ready for review.

As part of your pull request, please add yourself to the list of contributors in the [license file](LICENSE.md).
