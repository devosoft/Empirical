A library of tools for scientific software development, with emphasis on compiling to the web and
building web interfaces using the Emscripten compiler (from C++ to high efficiency JavaScript).

Top-level directory structure:

tools/    - Basic tools that are generally useful for scientific software.
emtools/  - Tools that make use of being compiled with emscripten.

config/   - Tools to setup a simple configuration system.
geometry/ - Geometry and physics-based tools for implementing simple virtual worlds.
hardware/ - Implementation of basic virtual hardware that is easy to configure.
scholar/  - Tools for tracking authors, citations, and bibliographies
web/      - Tools for builing web interfaces

evo/      - Tools for building evolution-based software, such as genetic algorithms, digital
            evolution systems, or agent-based simulations.

examples/ - Example code for many of the above tools
tests/    - Unit tests
utils/    - mini projects using Empirical with broad utility.
