{"Percent-encoding": "<p><b>URL encoding</b>, officially known as <b>percent-encoding</b>, is a method to encode arbitrary data in a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) using only the US-ASCII characters legal within a URI. Although it is known as <i>URL encoding</i>, it is also used more generally within the main Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) set, which includes both Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and Uniform Resource Name (URN). As such, it is also used in the preparation of data of the <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> media type, as is often used in the submission of HTML form data in HTTP requests.</p>", "Middle-square_method": "<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Middle-square_method.svg/320px-Middle-square_method.svg.png\" alt=\"Wikipedia thumbnail\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:10px;\"><p>In mathematics and computer science, the <b>middle-square method</b> is a method of generating pseudorandom numbers. In practice it is a highly flawed method for many practical purposes, since its period is usually very short and it has some severe weaknesses; repeated enough times, the middle-square method will either begin repeatedly generating the same number or cycle to a previous number in the sequence and loop indefinitely.</p>", "MurmurHash": "<p><b>MurmurHash</b> is a non-cryptographic hash function suitable for general hash-based lookup.\nIt was created by Austin Appleby in 2008 and is currently hosted on GitHub along with its test suite named 'SMHasher'. It also exists in a number of variants, all of which have been released into the public domain. The name comes from two basic operations, multiply (MU) and rotate (R), used in its inner loop.</p>", "Simple_matching_coefficient": "<p>The <b>simple matching coefficient (SMC)</b> or <b>Rand similarity coefficient</b> is a statistic used for comparing the similarity and diversity of sample sets.</p>"}
