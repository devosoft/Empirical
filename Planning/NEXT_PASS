Next time we do a full pass through files, we should:

* Use notify for proper error tracking.  Bias toward exceptions so developers can choose individualized responses to errors.
* Change member functions (and variables?) to begin with _
* Cleanup Doxygen?
* Move std::string to emp::String, where possible.
* Cleanup any SFINEA or other template tricks and use constexpr instead.


And if implemented
* Simplify emp_asserts to assume that will disentangle tests and print values of components?
* Add in the ability to turn on "EMP_THREADED" options?
* Add in serialization capabilities?
