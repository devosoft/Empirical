============

Firstly, thank you for making it this far. We really appreciate anyone who even
thinks about reporting an issue or helping out with the code or docs. It is kind
of you to take the time.

Please Provide an Example
-------------------------

If you're having trouble with how the contents of a particular Doxygen comment
or a particular set of code is being processed then please provide an example of
the in question.

Ideally as a pull-request with additions to the `examples/specific` folder but
feel free to provide the comment content in your issue instead.

It really helps to accelerate development if we have examples to work from.


Feel Free to Keep Reminding Me
------------------------------

Honesty time!

I am sorry that this is the case but I tend to get distracted and not give
Breathe the attention it deserves. Please do keep reminding me about your issue
if you would like it fixed. I'll try to be explicit if I really don't have the
time to fix it in the immediate future, but if I've made some vague promise to
look at it and you've heard nothing for 3 days then feel free to prod me again.
It will get fixed faster if you do and I promise not to get upset :)
